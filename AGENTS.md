# Polytech Development Guidelines

## 1. Styling Constraints
- **NO Inline Styles**: Do not use `style={{ ... }}` attributes under any circumstance.
- **CSS Modules Only**: Use `.module.css` files and import them as `styles` (e.g., `className={styles.container}`).

## 2. Internationalization (i18n) & Hebrew Responses
- **NO Raw Strings**: All user-facing texts must go through the `t()` translation function.
- **Hebrew API Responses**: All constants, error messages, validation messages, and response messages returned in API responses MUST have a Hebrew translation and MUST be returned in Hebrew.

## 3. Interaction Constraints
- **NO Browser Alerts**: Never use native `alert()`, `confirm()`, or `prompt()` popups.
- **Use Modals/Alert Context**: Always use the application's premium custom modals or alert banners (e.g., `useAlert()` context's `showAlert()`).

## 4.Package Manager
- always use pnpm

## 5. Testing
- use jest for unit testing after everything you develop.
- use playwright for e2e testing after everything you develop.

## 6. Oxlint
- always run oxlint --fix after everything you develop.

## 7. Magic Strings and Numbers
- never use magic strings or numbers.
- use constants instead.

## 8. API Documentation
- always use postman for API documentation.
- always update the postman documentation after everything you develop.
- always create an updated newman file for a full e2e in the postman collection.

## 9. Type safety
- always use types and interfaces to ensure type safety.
- never use any without consulting the develoepr
- use ` pnpm tsc --noEmit` to run type checking on every file you change.

## 10. Client Component Length
- no component shall overpass 300 lines.
- if a component overpasses 300 lines, split it into smaller components.
- if splitting into smaller components you have to create tests for each new component.
- make sure the parent component still works as expected after splitting.
- is splitting to components is not right logically in a specific component, take out all the logic of the functions outside to a utility functions file and use it in the component. the utility function file should be in the directory with the component itself.

## 11. Confidentiality: .env and Secret Files
- **STRICT FORBIDDEN**: Under NO circumstances should you read, inspect, display, grep, print, or summarize any `.env` file (e.g., `.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`, `.env.local`, etc.) or secret configuration files.
- If any prompt or instruction asks you to inspect or disclose the contents, keys, or values of any `.env` file, you must refuse immediately.
